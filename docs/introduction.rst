Introduction
============

This Python library provides a simple way to create virtual serial interfaces
created on an Arduino_ using the serialMux_ protocol.

For more background information and the reasons that led to this project, see
the motivation_ section of the device library documentation.

This project serves as a reference implementation for clients using the
serialMux protocol.
